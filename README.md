# Credit Risk Analysis 

## Executive Summary

This report presents a **credit risk analysis strictly filtered to defaulted loans**, with the objective of enabling management to understand **who is defaulting, under what conditions, and why**, so that corrective actions can be targeted with precision.

Within a total loan portfolio valued at **$6.56M**, there are **257 defaulted loans**, representing a **17.1% default rate**. Default occurrences show recurring spikes over time with **no sustained downward trend**, indicating that defaults are **systemic rather than incidental**.

Patterns observed across borrower profiles, loan structures, pricing bands, and tenors reveal **structural weaknesses in underwriting standards, affordability assessment, and post-disbursement monitoring**.

## Key Insights

### 1. Product Distribution of Defaults

Defaults are **almost evenly distributed across all loan products**.

**Insight:**
No single product category is responsible for the default problem. This confirms the issue is **portfolio-wide**, pointing to gaps in overall credit governance rather than isolated product failures.

---

### 2. Salary Profile of Defaulters

Default concentration is highest among **higher-income borrowers**:

* 46,170+ → 12.0%
* 33,449–46,169 → 3.3%
* 20,727–33,448 → 1.2%
* 8,008–20,726 → 0.8%

**Insight:**
Defaults are driven by **high loss severity rather than poor income access**. This suggests over-leveraging, weak affordability stress testing, or underestimation of existing financial commitments among high-earning borrowers.

---

### 3. Credit Score Characteristics

Defaults are concentrated in **mid-to-high credit score bands**:

* 576–713 → 9.0%
* 714+ → 8.1%
* 438–575 → 0.4%
* 300–437 → 0.4%

**Insight:**
Credit score alone is an **insufficient risk filter**. Repayment stress emerges post-disbursement, highlighting the need for behavioral and affordability-based risk assessment.

---

### 4. Interest Rate Exposure

Defaulted loans cluster in **moderate-to-high interest rate bands**, with the highest exposure in:

* 6.0–6.9%
* Followed by: 2.0–2.9%, 8.0–8.9%, and 4.0–4.9%

**Insight:**
Interest rate sensitivity is a key driver of defaults. As repayment costs increase, default risk rises even among borrowers with strong credit profiles.

---

### 5. Loan Tenor Profile

Defaults are most common in:

* 4-year loans → 5.3%
* 1-year loans → 4.9%
* 2-year loans → 3.8%
* 3-year loans → 3.6%

**Insight:**
Default risk peaks in **mid-tenor loans**, suggesting cumulative repayment pressure rather than immediate or long-term exposure alone.

---

### 6. Age Profile of Defaulters

Defaults are concentrated among **economically active age groups**:

* 42–48 → 5.2%
* 49–55 → 5.2%
* 28–34 → 4.5%
* 35–41 → 3.0%

**Insight:**
Defaults are driven by income volatility, financial obligations, and external economic pressures rather than age-related risk.

---

### 7. Time-Series Default Behavior

Default activity shows **recurring spikes across years** with no sustained improvement trend.

**Insight:**
The pattern is **structural and recurring**, indicating inconsistent underwriting quality and weak early-warning systems across origination periods.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Rebuild Underwriting Beyond Credit Scores

* Integrate affordability, debt-to-income, and cash-flow stress testing into approval decisions.
* Limit exposure concentration among high-salary but highly leveraged borrowers.

### 2. Risk-Based Pricing and Tenor Controls

* Reassess pricing structures within the **6.0%–9.9% interest rate bands**.
* Apply tighter approval thresholds and enhanced reviews for **4-year loan tenors**.

### 3. Default Prevention Through Early Signals

* Monitor behavioral indicators such as missed payments, partial payments, and repayment delays.
* Trigger proactive borrower engagement before accounts transition into full default.

### 4. Product-Neutral Risk Governance

* Apply consistent credit risk controls across all loan products, as defaults are evenly distributed and not product-specific.

---

## Conclusion

When analyzed exclusively through the lens of defaulted loans, the evidence clearly shows that defaults are **not confined to low-income, low-credit, or single-product borrowers**. Instead, they are driven by **affordability stress, interest rate pressure, and structural underwriting gaps**.

The recurring nature of defaults confirms the need for **systemic reform**, rather than isolated corrective actions.

---

## Next Steps

* Conduct **default vintage analysis** to identify high-risk origination periods.
* Redesign underwriting models to incorporate affordability and behavioral risk factors.
* Establish a **default-focused monitoring dashboard** tracking borrower attributes, loan structure, and pricing risk.
* Use insights from defaulted loans to recalibrate future lending policies and prevent repeat default outcomes.

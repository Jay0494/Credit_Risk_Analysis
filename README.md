# 📄 Project Description

**Credit Risk Assessment – Defaulted Loans Analysis**

A Power BI case study analyzing **defaulted loans** to identify systemic drivers of credit risk. The project demonstrates how affordability stress, pricing sensitivity, and underwriting gaps—not borrower quality—drive recurring defaults, and proposes data-backed reforms to reduce future credit losses.

# 📌 Case Study: Credit Risk Assessment – Defaulted Loans Analysis

## Background

Diaz Financial institutions often rely heavily on **credit scores and product segmentation** to manage default risk. However, persistent default cycles in this portfolio suggested that traditional risk signals were failing to capture **post-disbursement repayment stress**.

This case study analyzes **Defaulted loans only**, with the goal of identifying **systemic risk drivers** and providing **practical recommendations** that improve underwriting quality, pricing accuracy, and portfolio resilience.

---

## Problem Statement

Despite a reasonable **61.7% on-time repayment rate**, the portfolio experienced a **17.1% default rate** with recurring spikes over time.

Key business questions:

* Why are borrowers with **strong income and credit profiles** defaulting?
* Are defaults driven by specific products, or are they **portfolio-wide**?
* What changes would **materially reduce future defaults**?

---

## Approach

I conducted a **focused default-only analysis** using an interactive Power BI dashboard to:

* Isolate defaulted loans from the broader portfolio
* Analyze borrower characteristics (income, age, credit score)
* Evaluate loan structures (product, interest rate, tenure)
* Identify recurring time-series patterns
* Translate insights into **decision-ready recommendations**

This approach ensured findings were **actionable**, not descriptive.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. Defaults Are Portfolio-Wide

Defaults were **evenly distributed across all loan products**.

**Implication:**
The issue is not product design, but **credit governance and underwriting consistency**.

---

### 2. High-Income Borrowers Drive Loss Severity

The highest default concentration occurred among **higher-income borrowers**.

**Implication:**
Defaults stem from **over-leveraging and affordability misjudgment**, not income access.

---

### 3. Credit Scores Fail Post-Disbursement

Most defaulters had **mid-to-high credit scores**.

**Implication:**
Credit scores alone do not capture **repayment stress over time**.

---

### 4. Interest Rates Amplify Default Risk

Defaults clustered in **moderate-to-high interest bands**, peaking at **6.0%–6.9%**.

**Implication:**
Risk was **mispriced**, increasing repayment burden beyond borrower capacity.

---

### 5. Repayment Fatigue Drives Defaults

Defaults peaked in **2-year and 4-year loan tenors**.

**Implication:**
Risk accumulates through **repayment fatigue**, not immediate shock.

---

### 6. Structural, Repeatable Default Patterns

Default spikes recurred across multiple years with **no sustained improvement**.

**Implication:**
Weak early-warning systems allowed arrears to mature into defaults.

---

## Business Impact

### Financial Impact

* **17.1% default rate** materially reduced portfolio profitability
* Higher-income defaults resulted in **elevated loss severity**
* Expected yield underperformed in moderate-to-high interest bands

---

### Risk & Capital Impact

* Increased **Expected Credit Loss (ECL)** provisions
* Lower **risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)**
* Reduced effectiveness of product-level risk controls

---

### Operational Impact

* Increased collections workload and recovery costs
* Late intervention allowed preventable defaults to crystallise

---

### Strategic Impact

* False confidence in portfolio quality due to strong borrower profiles
* High probability of **repeat default cycles** without reform

---

## Recommendations

* Integrate **affordability stress testing** and debt-to-income metrics into underwriting
* Apply **risk-based pricing** and enhanced review for high-risk tenors
* Deploy **early-warning indicators** for proactive borrower engagement
* Enforce **product-neutral credit governance** across the portfolio

---

## Outcome

This analysis reframed default risk from a **borrower quality issue** to a **systemic underwriting and pricing problem**, enabling management to focus on **structural fixes** rather than reactive collections.
